    "text": "I am currently pursuing a Master’s of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022 with an Earth Science B.S. with a concentration in geohydrology and a Geography B.A. with a concentration in G.I.S.\nMy current goal is to work on the problems of clean water in conjunction with remote sensing and the application of data science is at the forefront of dealing with these issues. Improving water use efficiency, reduction of wasteful water use, real-time water quality monitoring, forecasting water quality, and identifying issues with water supply are the problems that I seek to apply the data science skills I am attaining from the MEDS program. The issues associated with water are global and the opportunity to help in these areas speaks directly to what I seek to accomplish professionally."

    "text": "Methods\n\n\n\nHOCL Grades\nRedlining is a discriminatory practice that assigned neighborhood gradings (A-D) based on desirability\\(^1\\):\nA = Best\nB = Still Desirable\nC = Declining\nD = Hazardous\nMortgage lender denied loans and/or restricted services to certain areas of a community, often because of the racial characteristics of the applicant’s neighborhood included into the grading such as:\n• “Undesirable negro section of very poor property”\n• “Concentration of undesirables. Low class whites and negro”\n\n\n\nRedline regions were overlayed over Philadelphia to determine areas of analysis\n\n\n\n\nGreenness Over Time, 1990 - 2020\nChange detection of vegetation was performed by loading 1990 mean NDVI in red channel and 2020 mean NDVI in blue and green channels.\n\n2020 increases in vegetation are observed in central region and Northwest and Southeast boundaries Urban areas in southern portion show very little change of vegetation on both sides of river since 1990\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of average NDVI and percent difference show all areas experience a decrease in NDVI with Grade “A” regions exhibiting the most loss followed by “D” grade regions\n\n\n\n\nNDVI and Household Median Income\nThe analysis was performed by selecting only areas ‘A’, ‘D’, and the areas outside the redlining to compare the relationship between NDVI and Median Income in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.\nIn 1990, the NDVI was higher (≈ 0.25 – 0.4), and median income was lower (≈ $ 25,000). In 2000, the NDVI started to continuously decrease (≈ 0.18 – 0.27) till 2020 in all areas, as median income keeps increasing (≈ $ 54,000).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The correlation between mean NDVI and median household income is inversely proportional. As income increases, NDVI decreases in the three areas over the decades.\n\n\nChange in NDVI between 1990 and 2020 becomes less linear since the Census tracts that lost the most greenness was composed of areas ‘A’. While areas ‘D’ experienced a smaller, but still significant, decrease in greenness as well.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Average NDVI and the median income of each redline block that comprises areas ‘A’ and ‘D’.\n\n\n\n\nNDVI and Disability\nFive different study areas:\n• D Group\n• A Group\n• Census tract that lies outside of Redline area\n• D Group based on HOLC grade\n\nResults:\n• D Group has lowest mean NDVI, and high number of disabled people compared to A Group\n• A Group has highest mean NDVI and lowest number of disability reports\n• In the urban center, also has low NDVI and high number of disabilities reported\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Graph showing both the mean NDVI in 2020 with the red line and the number of disability reports in 2020 with the blue bar\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFor general trends, the data showed that average NDVI for areas with a grade of “A” showed the most loss over 4 decades. Areas graded “D” showed nearly the same amount of NDVI difference despite initially having much lower NDVI values in 1990. Median Household Income increases with lower mean NDVI values: this holds true in areas A, D and non-redlined zones. This is consistent with the findings from Casey et al. proving how urban greenness is unequally distributed with neighborhood demographics. Disability, followed areas of greater redlining (lower grades) and areas of lower NDVI values. Within redlined areas, all areas with “A” grades have significantly higher NDVI values, higher medium income and lower disability rates than all areas with a “D” grade. Overall, the presence of green areas in urban spaces have positive impacts to the individual, including lower rates of disabilities and higher median income levels. Areas that are within the redlined boundaries experience these lower standards of living compared to areas that are not redlined. City planners and local/state governments should increase greenness and promote social equity goals, especially in these disadvantaged communities.\n\n\nReferences\n\nNardone, Anthony, et al. “Redlines and Greenspace: The Relationship between Historical Redlining and 2010 Greenspace across the United States.” National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 27 Jan.2021, https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP7495.\nCasey, J.A.; James, P.; Cushing, L.; Jesdale, B.M.; Morello-Frosch, R.
