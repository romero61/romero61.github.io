    "text": "Methods\n\n\n\nHOCL Grades\nRedlining is a discriminatory practice that assigned neighborhood gradings (A-D) based on desirability\\(^1\\):\nA = Best\nB = Still Desirable\nC = Declining\nD = Hazardous\nMortgage lender denied loans and/or restricted services to certain areas of a community, often because of the racial characteristics of the applicant’s neighborhood included into the grading such as:\n• “Undesirable negro section of very poor property”\n• “Concentration of undesirables. Low class whites and negro”\n\n\n\nRedline regions were overlayed over Philadelphia to determine areas of analysis\n\n\n\n\nGreenness Over Time, 1990 - 2020\nChange detection of vegetation was performed by loading 1990 mean NDVI in red channel and 2020 mean NDVI in blue and green channels.\n\n2020 increases in vegetation are observed in central region and Northwest and Southeast boundaries Urban areas in southern portion show very little change of vegetation on both sides of river since 1990\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of average NDVI and percent difference show all areas experience a decrease in NDVI with Grade “A” regions exhibiting the most loss followed by “D” grade regions\n\n\n\n\nNDVI and Household Median Income\nThe analysis was performed by selecting only areas ‘A’, ‘D’, and the areas outside the redlining to compare the relationship between NDVI and Median Income in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.\nIn 1990, the NDVI was higher (≈ 0.25 – 0.4), and median income was lower (≈ $ 25,000). In 2000, the NDVI started to continuously decrease (≈ 0.18 – 0.27) till 2020 in all areas, as median income keeps increasing (≈ $ 54,000).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The correlation between mean NDVI and median household income is inversely proportional. As income increases, NDVI decreases in the three areas over the decades.\n\n\nChange in NDVI between 1990 and 2020 becomes less linear since the Census tracts that lost the most greenness was composed of areas ‘A’. While areas ‘D’ experienced a smaller, but still significant, decrease in greenness as well.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Average NDVI and the median income of each redline block that comprises areas ‘A’ and ‘D’.\n\n\n\n\nNDVI and Disability\nFive different study areas:\n• D Group\n• A Group\n• Census tract that lies outside of Redline area\n• D Group based on HOLC grade\n\nResults:\n• D Group has lowest mean NDVI, and high number of disabled people compared to A Group\n• A Group has highest mean NDVI and lowest number of disability reports\n• In the urban center, also has low NDVI and high number of disabilities reported\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Graph showing both the mean NDVI in 2020 with the red line and the number of disability reports in 2020 with the blue bar\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFor general trends, the data showed that average NDVI for areas with a grade of “A” showed the most loss over 4 decades. Areas graded “D” showed nearly the same amount of NDVI difference despite initially having much lower NDVI values in 1990. Median Household Income increases with lower mean NDVI values: this holds true in areas A, D and non-redlined zones. This is consistent with the findings from Casey et al. proving how urban greenness is unequally distributed with neighborhood demographics. Disability, followed areas of greater redlining (lower grades) and areas of lower NDVI values. Within redlined areas, all areas with “A” grades have significantly higher NDVI values, higher medium income and lower disability rates than all areas with a “D” grade. Overall, the presence of green areas in urban spaces have positive impacts to the individual, including lower rates of disabilities and higher median income levels. Areas that are within the redlined boundaries experience these lower standards of living compared to areas that are not redlined. City planners and local/state governments should increase greenness and promote social equity goals, especially in these disadvantaged communities.\n\n\nReferences\n\nNardone, Anthony, et al. “Redlines and Greenspace: The Relationship between Historical Redlining and 2010 Greenspace across the United States.” National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 27 Jan.2021, https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP7495.\nCasey, J.A.; James, P.; Cushing, L.; Jesdale, B.M.; Morello-Frosch, R.

    "title": "Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll-a Using Landsat 8",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Data\nIn-situ measurements of the study were taken before, during, and after the wastewater diversion event along a grid of 13 stations between August 26th and November 11th and, when possible, coinciding during satellite overpass in the SMB. At all stations, hydrographic profiles were collected using an SBE 19-plus Conductivity-Temperature-Depth package with chlorophyll fluorescence collected from 1m below the surface to 1m above the ocean floor. In-situ surface chlorophyll-a concentrations were derived from water samples taken on ten different dates at selected stations. Water samples were taken at 1 meter and analyzed fluorometrically for chl-a in a laboratory using a non-acidification method for 96 measurements. In-situ hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance was measured and derived from field measurements of spectral downwelling and upwelling irradiance using a Satlantic HyperPRO free-falling optical profiler equipped with a surface irradiance reference for a total of 49 measurements on nine separate dates. Level 1 satellite data was acquired from Landsat 8 from OLI, TIRS sensors, and level 1 satellite data from Aqua MODIS, TIR sensors.\nThe analysis extension uses Landsat 8 OLI Level-2 surface reflectance products on six dates from June 6th to November 11th, 2021. Level-2 products are corrected for the temporally, spatially, and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases,aerosols, and water vapor. All images acquired from USGS are centered on 33°10’36.66”N – 118°42’58.32”W, on path 41 row 37 with a WGS84 datum and ellipsoid, on a U1TM Zone 11 projection.\n\n\nMethod\nUsing 36 measurements of in-situ data, two local chl-a algorithms were developed using respective blue and green wavebands of OLI and MODIS, where the natural log values of the measured surface chl-a concentrations are regressed on the natural log values of blue-green surface reflectance ratios (Figure 1).\n\nMODIS satellite data were used to produce a standard 1-km OC3M product (OC3M algorithm), a regional product (CALFIT algorithm), and application of their own locally derived algorithm to produce chl-a concentrations. Landsat 8 data retrievals from USGS were used to produce a standard OC2 chl-a product and application of their own locally derived algorithm to produce chl-a concentrations. To assess the accuracy of Landsat 8 (OC2) and MODIS (OC3M, CALFIT) algorithms to estimate chl-a concentrations, each algorithm was used with their respective blue-green wavebands (Figure 1) from in-situ measurements and compared to in-situ chl-a concentrations. Landsat 8 and MODIS surface reflectance data were applied to standard algorithms and the researcher’s local algorithm and compared against in-situ chl-a concentrations. A time-series analysis was completed using the local chl-a algorithm for OLI in which maximum chl-a concentrations for each OLI scene were found within Santa Monica Bay. Sea surface temperatures. Level 1 products of Landsat 8 and Aqua MODIS data were atmospherically corrected using a standard multi-scattering, radiative transfer model (TIRS), and iterative near-infrared (NIR) model (TIR). TIRS temperature was retrieved by inverting the atmospherically, and emissivity corrected TIRS radiances using a look-up table. Due to limitations of both OLI and MODIS accuracy and spatial extent of MODIS TIR, TIRS is only used to detect relative SST differences between plume and non-plume waters.\nThe extension of the analysis acquired images in 2021 on six different dates, July 6th and 22nd, August 7th, October 10th and 26th, and November 11th. The images acquired were the best available in the study area without cloud cover. Pre-processing was performed in R using library packages “rgdal” and “raster” the images of surface reflectance of bands 2-7 were stacked together by date. Each image was masked and cropped using a custom Shapefile derived from a Los Angeles County Shapefile, limiting the extent to the coastal waters of the SMB up to the coastline. Erroneous pixel values that do not fall within the valid range for the Landsat surface reflectance product were overwritten; the valid range for all bands 1-7 is 7273-43636. The scale factor of the images was changed to 100. A time-series analysis was produced using the researchers’ local OLI algorithm of chl-a concentrations applying blue and green bands of each image data and exported for use in Qgis.\n\n\nResults\nWastewater plume detection via sea surface temperature (SST) was clearly detected by Landsat 8 TIRS, showing the relative temperature difference between the wastewater plume and ambient waters. Before and after the diversion event, no SST anomalies were detected; during the diversion event, at the 1- mile outfall pipe, decreased SSTs were clearly detected ~1 °C colder than the surrounding water. Comparisons to in-situ data were not provided due to TIRS SST data providing skin surface temperature measurements of the top few millimeters of the ocean surface, and in-situ measurements were taken at depths greater than 1m below the surface.\nThe results of comparing estimated chl-a using standard algorithms and in-situ reflectance were reported as mean percent errors between estimated chl-a values and in-situ values. The OC2 algorithm had a ±40% mean percent error, the paper’s OLI local algorithm yielding a ±30% mean percent error using in-situ reflectance. The OC3M algorithm resulted in a ±35% mean percent error, with the regional CALFIT algorithm reported as more accurately estimating chl-a values but greatly overestimating high chl-a values. The derived local MODIS algorithm using in-situ reflectance resulted in estimated values with a mean percent error of ±32% of in-situ chl-a values. The standard algorithms tended to underestimate mid-level chl-a values and overestimate high chl-a values with respect to measured values, with the highest values falling well above the +30% error. The researcher’s local OLI algorithm was the best performing algorithm, with the lowest mean percent error and more accurate estimated chl-a values.\nThe researchers used the scenes of Landsat 8 and MODIS on November 11th, 2015, to apply both the local algorithm and the standard chl-a algorithms, as this was the only day the satellite data coincided with in-situ reflectance and chl-a measurements (Figure 2). Overall, OLI chl-a retrievals were more accurate than MODIS. The local OLI chl-a algorithm outperformed MODIS (local and OC3M) and OC2 algorithms with a mean percent error of ∼29% and the smallest RMSE of ∼0.36. The standard OC2 algorithm underestimated chl-a values and had a mean percent error of ∼26% and RMSE of ∼0.58. The local MODIS chl-a algorithm performed better than the OC3M algorithm but still overestimated chl-a concentrations with a mean percent error of ∼37% and RMSE of ∼0.67. The standard OC3M algorithm had a mean percent error of ∼349% and RMSE of∼18.2, performing order of magnitude poorer than the local MODIS chl-a algorithm and either OLI algorithm (local or OC2). Establishing that the researchers Local OLI algorithm performed best, a time series analysis was used to evaluate the chlorophyll-a evolution in response to the wastewater diversion event (Figure 2).\n\nThe time series analysis was extended to observe the chlorophyll-a evolution in response to the HPT failure on July 11th, 2021(Figure 3). An initial 17 million gallons (5 million were pumped back) of untreated sewage was discharged through the 1-mile outfall pipe, shown on the researcher’s time series as the shorter black line. Reports indicate that the plant operated at a diminished capacity afterward. To show the evolution of chlorophyll-a, the main images are set to the scale of 7-22, using a cumulative count cut of 2%- 98% to filter out outliers in minimum and maximum values. The top end of the green portion of the scale represents an ~3.0 mg m-3, comparable to the researcher’s time-series scale. The top inset of each image uses individual scales, using a cumulative count cut of 2%- 98% to filter out outliers in minimum and maximum values. Each image’s bottom inset uses a cumulative count cut of 2%- 94% using a true-color image emphasizing the ocean color.\n\nThe first image before HTP failure shows elevated chlorophyll-a beginning ~3-miles offshore at ~3.0 mg m-3 with pockets of higher values. The results on 07-22, eleven days after failure, are obfuscated by sporadic cloud coverage; despite this, there is evidence of elevated values of chl-a up against the coastline. In-situ measurements of chl-a concentrations could not be located to corroborate due to Covid-19 sampling restrictions; the only supporting evidence is a graph of Harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Figure 4) of Pseudo-nitzschia measured shortly up thecoast at the Santa Monica Pier. HABs of Pseudo-nitzschia can cause diseases and death in many marine organisms and the humans who consume them. HABs can result in oxygen depletion caused by increased biomass production (Timmerman, 2019). On 8-22, twenty-seven days after the massive HTP failure, chl-a concentration is still exceedingly high along the coastline. The final three images show an average of 1.74 mg m-3 along the coastline when compared to the researcher’s scale is still on the high end. The November spike of Pseudo-nitzschia supports that the diminished capacity of HTP may have influenced any natural variations of phytoplankton biomass.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Measurements of HABs from Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System. The focus is on July and November spikes.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe researcher’s central finding is that applying their local chl-a algorithms, developed using in situ chl-a and in-situ reflectance measurements improves chl-a retrievals in the SMB during the 2015 HTP wastewater diversion in comparison to the standard open ocean algorithms. The paper also demonstrates the improved accuracy of chl-a from high-resolution OLI compared to coarser resolution MODIS for coastal chl-a detection. The researcher’s study was the first to use high-resolution Landsat 8 TIRS and OLI for coastal water quality monitoring of wastewater diversions. The extension of the analysis uses the researcher’s improved accuracy to measure the chl-a concentration in response to the HTP failure of 2021. Limited corroborating measurements limited the analysis to visual interpretation. Spatial-Temporal changes in chl-a concentrations are indicative of the possible effect of the 17 million gallons of untreated wastewater discharged into SMB. Further studies can apply these findings to a more in-depth analysis of the damage to the coastal water quality of the SMB and its effect on its marine ecosystems.\n\n\nReferences\nTimmerman, R.
