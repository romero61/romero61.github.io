  <p>
   As a dedicated environmental data scientist, I've honed my skills at the intersection of data science, geography, and machine learning.
   
   I hold a Master's of Data Science in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara. I also earned an Earth Science B.S. with a concentration in geohydrology and a Geography B.A. with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in 2022.
   
   My primary interest lies in leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to address critical environmental and climate issues. I am particularly captivated by the potential of remote sensing and earth observation in enhancing our understanding of the environment.
   
   The skills and knowledge I've acquired from the Bren School have prepared me to tackle a wide range of environmental challenges. Whether it's improving resource efficiency, monitoring environmental quality in real-time, forecasting environmental changes, or assessing community resources, I am convinced that these are problems with data science at their core.
   
   I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to using data science to improve our environment and the lives of those around us. This is what I aspire to achieve professionally.
