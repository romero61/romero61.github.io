Deciding that I needed to alter my life's trajectory I decided to leave my career in supply chain logistics as my outdoor passion drove me towards making an impact.

I am currently pursuing a Master's of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022 with an Earth Science B.S. with a concentration in geohydrology and a Geography B.A. with a concentration in G.I.S.

Data science is at the forefront of addressing today\'s water crises. My goal is to focus on the problem of clean water in conjunction with remote sensing. Improving water use efficiency, reduction of wasteful water use, real-time water quality monitoring, forecasting water quality, and assessing community water sources are all problems with data science at their core. The skills I have gained from the Bren School will allow me to engage with these problems as a data scientist. The opportunities for data science to improve the water and lives of those around me speaks directly to what I seek to accomplish professionally.
