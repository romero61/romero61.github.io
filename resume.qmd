## Master's Capstone Project - Informing Forest Conservation Regulations in Paraguay (1/22--Present)

Client: Paraguay National Forest Institute; Dr. Robert Heilmayr \| Role: Machine Learning Engineer

• Utilized geospatial overlays to assess the compliance of property owners' execution of approved land use plans (LUPs) and calculate land use types and percent of clearing.

• Created a law-based simulation tool in R to evaluate the effects of current and alternate laws on conserved forest area in the undeveloped Chaco region.

• Trained a convolutional neural network in Python to predict future deforestation patterns based on historic deforestation patterns and forestry laws.

## GEOSPATIAL & DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

### Burn Severity with Sentinel-2 data using Google Earth Engine \| Working with Environmental Data (12/22)

• Burn severity analysis of the August Complex Fire using Sentinel-2 Image Collection and MTBS Feature Collection.

• Utilized Google Earth Engine and Python to process and visualize the difference normalized burn ratio (DNBR) by severity class.

• Leveraged the GEE platform to process and analyze large-scale satellite data efficiently and effectively.

### Statistical Analysis of NDVI in Redlined Regions \| Statistics for Environmental Data Science (11/22)

• Conducted data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using tidy format in R.

• Conducted statistical analysis of NDVI data in redlined regions using Log-Log Ordinary Least Squares Regression and hypothesis testing to draw informed conclusions on non-linear relationships.

• Interpreted regression coefficients to understand the impact of individual variables on overall outcome.

### Analyzing Greenness through NDVI in Redlined areas in Philadelphia, PA \| Undergraduate Thesis (4/22--6/22)

• Pre-process Landsat 8 OLI satellite data using RStudio to crop, mask, reclassify, and NDVI calculation.

• Conducted QGIS processing to calculate NDVI, zonal statistics, and write memory function.

• Integrated census median income data, NDVI data, and Redline data through QGIS and Excel.
